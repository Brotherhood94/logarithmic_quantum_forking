# Logarithmic Quantum Forking

The forking framework provided by the Logarithmic Quantum Forking technique proves useful when (1) we want to use a given quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ multiple times in the same circuit, (2) the state preparation procedure for $\ket{\psi}$ is non-trivial, and (3) the number $q$ of qubits of the quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ is not negligible.

The repository shows a use case of Logarithmic Quantum Forking and the [“Quantum Forking-based Sampling”](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab35fb/meta) over the distance-based classified defined [“here”](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/119/60002).
